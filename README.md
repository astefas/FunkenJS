# FunkenJS
Just a NodeJS Javascript class / wrapper around Serialconnection interfacing with [Funken](https://github.com/astefas/Funken).

## Installing FunkenJS
FunkenJS is available as a node-module. If you are not familiar with NodeJS please visit [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Locally
For installing it inside your project locally use : npm install --save-dev
### Globally
For installing it globally use : npm install -g 

## Examples for FunkenJS
For an example on how to setup event listeners and orchestrate these events please see:

[FunkenJSTEST](https://github.com/astefas/FunkenJS/tree/master/doc/examples/)

## Documentation
I will document FunkenJS in the future. It is a rather small class and therefore kind of self explaining.
